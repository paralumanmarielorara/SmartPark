- **Workflow**: Configured and running

## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
src/
  main/
    java/
      com/
        Main.java - Main application entry point
        model/
          ParkingLot.java - Parking lot data model
          Vehicle.java - Vehicle data model
          VehicleType.java - Vehicle type enumeration (CAR, MOTORCYCLE, TRUCK)
```
